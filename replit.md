- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Deployment**: Production build with esbuild for server bundling

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Using Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactions

### Backend Architecture
